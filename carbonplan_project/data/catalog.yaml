            The Integrated Carbon Observation System, ICOS, is a European-wide greenhouse gas
            research infrastructure. ICOS produces standardised data on greenhouse gas
            concentrations in the atmosphere, as well as on carbon fluxes between the
            atmosphere, the earth and oceans.
